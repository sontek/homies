This package contains a Git client extension for AWS Elastic
Beanstalk. AWS DevTools enables you to deploy applications to AWS
Elastic Beanstalk quickly. AWS DevTools can run on the Linux, Mac, and
Windows operating systems. If you are already familiar with using the
Git command line, then you'll want to use AWS DevTools.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an even easier way for you to quickly deploy
and manage applications in the AWS cloud. AWS Elastic Beanstalk
leverages AWS services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon
EC2), Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Simple
Notification Service (Amazon SNS), Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto
Scaling to deliver the same highly reliable, scalable, and
cost-effective infrastructure that hundreds of thousands of businesses
depend on today.

application, go to
